# XKCD Butterflies for the Atom Editor by GitHub
__Real Programmers use butterflies__

This is a simple plugin for the Atom Editor. It provides a Menu Option to harness the power of the butterfly to write your program.

# Requirements

You will need the [GitHub Atom Editor](http://atom.io), as well as some sort of way to clone the repository, as the bugs with the publishing are still being worked out.  
   `cd ~/.atom/plugins;  
   git clone http://github.com/naviabbot/butterfly.git;  
   cd butterfly;  
   npm install`  

There you go... you have access to harness the power of the butterfly!
